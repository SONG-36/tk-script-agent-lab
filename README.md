# tk-script-agent-lab

`tk-script-agent-lab` is a learning-oriented TikTok Script Agent Lab for an AI product manager. The project is intentionally built in phases so each step can separate product thinking from model behavior, deterministic code, validation, and later agent orchestration.

## Current Phase

Current status: Phase 0 only.

Phase 0 establishes the repository baseline, reference audit archive, learning roadmap, technology boundaries, Golden Case fixtures, and import/test scaffolding.

There is no real Agent in this phase. There are no model calls, tools, RAG, LangGraph workflows, TikTok API integrations, scraping integrations, or production services.

## Learning Goal

The project is designed to help understand:

- data flow between user input, internal state, and output;
- model boundaries and where LLMs should not make decisions;
- deterministic code responsibilities;
- likely points where a system can fabricate, overclaim, or hide uncertainty;
- validation methods before and after model usage;
- staged evaluation of script quality and factual safety.

## Phase Model

The lab evolves one phase at a time. Phase 0 is only the project and learning baseline. Later phases may introduce deterministic domain models, real LLM usage, minimal RAG, LangGraph, tool calling, and eval loops, but none of those are implemented yet.

## Current Non-Goals

- no multi-agent system;
- no automated TikTok publishing;
- no complex platform or dashboard;
- no production deployment;
- no real creator scraping;
- no business API integration;
- no copied `enrichment_agent` package from the reference project.

## Reference

This project studies architecture patterns from `langchain-ai/data-enrichment`, especially state layering, graph entry design, structured output concepts, conditional routing, budget controls, Studio debugging, and test layering. The new project does not depend on the reference repository at runtime and does not import its package.
